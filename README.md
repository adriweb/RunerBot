RunerBot, an IRC bot coded in mIRC scripting language (I know, gross) for TI
z80/ez80 help.

## Setup

1. Get mIRC working. I use an ancient version, 7.15, but maybe new versions are
   fully compatible.
2. Load all scripts/*_a.mrc files as "Aliases" scripts, and scripts/*_rs.mrc
   files as "Remote" scripts.
3. Set the top few alises in scripts/omni_a.mrc properly.
